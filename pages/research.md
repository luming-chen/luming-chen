#### <u>Quid Pro Quo: Liquidity Insurance in US Tri-party Repos</u>
*This paper provides a comprehensive examination of how over-the-counter trading relationships significantly affect short-term interest rate dynamics in the US tri-party repo market. We test the prediction that over-the-counter search friction incentivize dealers to pay a liquidity insurance premium to their relationship money market funds (MMFs). In case of a market wide liquidity shortage, dealers can still obtain funds from their relationship funds at favorable terms, thus effectively smoothing out the negative shock. Specifically, we use the Oct.2016 MMF Reform as a quasi-natural experiment to find relationship funds provide short-term financing at favorable rates and haircuts to linked dealers. We also find the trading relationships are stable over time. In case of a forced drop of relationship funds during the liquidation of Charles Schwab Money Market Sweep Funds, dealers had to bear a higher cost when searching for new partners. These findings imply that relationship significantly impact short-term rates, and relationship bundling might exacerbate the next crisis if MMFs experience fund runs.*
